\section{Solution Construction}

\subsection{Introduction}
The minimum cost flow problem can intuitively be represented as a graph problem where the goal is to find the cheapest way to flow a commodity through your graph. This section discusses three solution construction methods that were proposed to generate ant solution to the MCFP domain.

\subsection{Alternated Move and Push}\label{sec:alternated_move_and_push}

This first approach is also the most naturalistic solution construction method that was considered. The idea was to repeatedly let an ant walk along a path from the source to a sink node until the ant trails formed a network that connected all demand nodes to the source node. Empirically, this approach was strongly rooted in nature, where ant colonies have to organize trail systems leading to food sources in their environment.

This strategy entails an incremental solution construction, where a single solution is constructed by letting the ant walk through the graph multiple times. An illustration of the procedure is depicted in \Cref{fig:alternated_move_and_push_construction}. At each junction the ant faces, it chooses one of the paths randomly. Expressed in a different way, the solution is constructed by a series of local decisions and can be characterized as a decentralized strategy.

The Alternated Move and Push strategy is proof that a system of simple agents are able to cooperate through interaction with the environment and solve flow path problems. This procedure is a general solver for capacitated edge problems. If the problem can be described as a graph with edges, the ants can be used as a meta-solver. Whether the problem is to find the maximum flow and minimum cost, or to find the shortest TSP; the ants are dependant upon the edges pheromone level. This abstraction of the problem domain enables the strategy to be used as a general solver.

\subsubsection{Application to the MCFP domain}
In order to apply this approach to solve problems in the MCFP domain we have to transform the problem into a capacitated graph. This was easily achieved through a three step process. First, we add a super-sink to the graph. The super-sink will be the only demand node. Second, we add edges leading for each demand node into the super-sink. Finally, we infinite capacity to the internal edges, while the edges leading to the super-sink has a capacity equal to the demand of the originating node.

   \caption[Introducting a super-sink to MCFP]{Introducing a super-sink to the uncapacitated single source, multiple sink minimum cost flow problem.}\label{fig:MCFP-supersink}
\end{figure}

The result of this process is depicted in \Cref{fig:MCFP-supersink}. The demand from demand nodes $D = {2, 3, 4, 5}$ has been replaced by capacitated edges into the supersink. The capacity of the corresponding edge mirror the demand of the starting node.


\subsection{Depth First Search}
Construct a tree using a stochastic depth first search where the edges are chosen proportionately to their pheromone.

When surveying \Cref{fig:alternated_move_and_push_construction} and analyzing the solution construction approach in \fullref{sec:alternated_move_and_push}, we can deduct that the solutions produced by a single ant shares similarities with a depth first search. The ant is consecutively faced with edge conjunctions in the graph until it reaches the supersink.

\subsection{Spanning Tree Construction}
Construct stochastic MSTs of the graph where the edges are chosen proportionately to their pheromone. All min cost solution will be trees.

Hvis vi definerer et MST som den korteste veien fra en root node til alle andre noder. Hvis vi så tenker at vi lar kosten det tar å flyte en commodity langs en kant tilsvare avstanden mellom to noder, kan vi tenke at å konstruere en MST fra source-noden vår vil produsere nærmere optimale løsninger. Konstruere en MST fra root noden er det samme NP komplette problemet som å løse MCFP. Hvordan kan vi ameliorate dette? Vi kan ikke være grådige og må heller bruke en randomisert approach. La oss heller konstruere MSTet hvor sannsynligheten for å inkludere en gitt edge er proposjonal med som pheromonverdien til den gitte kanten. Vi vet at når $t \rightarrow \infty$, vil kantene som er med i den beste løsningen ha mye mer pheromoner andre kanter. Dermed vil vi i limit ha mye større sannsynglihet for å generere det optimale MST.
