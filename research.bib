abstract = {The ant system is a new meta-heuristic for hard combinatorial optimization problems. It is a population-based approach that uses exploitation of positive feedback as well as greedy search. It was first proposed for tackling the well known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), but has been also successfully applied to problems such as quadratic assignment, job-shop scheduling, vehicle routing and graph colouring. In this paper we introduce a new rank based version of the ant system and present results of a computational study, where we compare the ant system with simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm on several TSP instances. It turns out that our rank based ant system can compete with the other methods in terms of average behavior, and shows even better worst case behavior.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms have attracted the interest of researchers due to their simplicity, effectiveness and efficiency in solving complex optimization problems. Both ACO and PSO were successfully applied for solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Performance of the conventional PSO algorithm for small problems with moderate dimensions and search space is very satisfactory. As the search, space gets more complex, conventional approaches tend to offer poor solutions. This paper presents a novel approach by introducing a PSO, which is modified by the ACO algorithm to improve the performance. The new hybrid method (PSO–ACO) is validated using the TSP benchmarks and the empirical results considering the completion time and the best length, illustrate that the proposed method is efficient.},

abstract = {Studies on small-world networks have received intensive interdisciplinary attention during the past several years. It is well-known among researchers that a small-world network is often characterized by high connectivity and clustering, but so far there exist few effective approaches to evaluate small-world properties, especially for spatial networks. This paper proposes a method to examine the small-world properties of spatial networks from the perspective of network autocorrelation. Two network autocorrelation statistics, Moran's I and Getis-Ord's G, are used to monitor the structural properties of networks in a process of "rewiring" networks from a regular to a random network. We discovered that Moran's I and Getis-Ord's G tend to converge and have relatively low values when properties of small-world networks emerge. Three transportation networks at the national, metropolitan, and intra-city levels are analyzed using this approach. It is found that spatial networks at these three scales possess small-world properties when the correlation lag distances reach certain thresholds, implying that the manifestation of small-world phenomena result from the interplay between the network structure and the dynamics taking place on the network. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

As a result of this organization, ant colonies can accomplish complex tasks that in some cases far exceed the individual capacities of a single ant. The study of ant colonies behavior and of their self-organizing capacities is interesting for computer scientists because it provides models of distributed organization which are useful to solve difficult optimization and distributed control problems. In this paper we overview some models derived from the observation of real ants, emphasizing the role played by stigmergy as distributed communication paradigm, and we show how these models have inspired a number of novel algorithms for the solution of distributed optimization and distributed control problems.},

abstract = {The organizations of insect societies, such as division of labor, task allocation, collective regulation, mass action responses, have been considered as main reasons for the ecological success. In this article, we propose and study a general modeling framework that includes the following three features: (a) the average internal response threshold for each task (the internal factor); (b) social network communications that could lead to task switching (the environmental factor); and (c) dynamical changes of task demands (the external factor). Since workers in many social insect species exhibit $\backslash$emph{\{}age polyethism{\}}, we also extend our model to incorporate $\backslash$emph{\{}age polyethism{\}} in which worker task preferences change with age. We apply our general modeling framework to the cases of two task groups: the inside colony task versus the outside colony task. Our analytical study of the models provides important insights and predictions on the effects of colony size, social communication, and age related task preferences on task allocation and division of labor in the adaptive dynamical environment. Our study implies that the smaller size colony invests its resource for the colony growth and allocates more workers in the risky tasks such as foraging while the larger colony shifts more workers to perform the safer tasks inside the colony. Social interactions among different task groups play an important role in shaping task allocation depending on the relative cost and demands of the tasks.},

We argue that division of labor can emerge from such systems even without a history of natural selection, that in fact such ordered behavior is an inescapable property of group living. We then show how natural selection can operate on self-organized complex systems(social organization) and result in adaptation of division of labor. (C) Inra/DIB/AGIB/Elsevier, Paris.},

Studies of division of labor are concerned with the integration of individual worker behavior into colony level task organization and with the question of how regulation of division of labor may contribute to colony efficiency. Here we describe and critique the current models concerned with the proximate causes of division of labor in social insects. The models have identified various proximate mechanisms to explain division of labor, based on both internal and external factors. On the basis of these factors, we suggest a classification of the models. We first describe the different types of models and then review the empirical evidence supporting them. The models to date may be considered preliminary and exploratory; they have advanced our understanding by suggesting possible mechanisms for division of labor and by revealing how individual and colony-level behavior may be related. They suggest specific hypotheses that can be tested by experiment and so may lead to the development of more powerful and integrative explanatory models.},

abstract = {A model of division of labour in insect societies, based on variable response thresholds is introduced. Response thresholds refer to the likelihood of reacting to task-associated stimuli. Low-threshold individuals perform tasks at a lower level of stimulus than high-threshold individuals. Within individual workers, performing a given task induces a decrease in the corresponding threshold, and not performing the task induces an increase in the threshold. This combined reinforcement process leads to the emergence of specialized workers, i.e. workers that are more responsive to stimuli associated with particular task requirements, from a group of initially identical individuals. Predictions of the dynamics of task specialization resulting from this model are presented. Predictions are also made as to what should be observed when specialists of a given task are removed from the colony and reintroduced after a varying amount of time: the colony does not recover the same state as that prior to the perturbation, and the difference between before and after the perturbation is more strongly marked as the time between separation and reintroduction increases.},

abstract = {In this article, we propose UACOR, a unified ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for continuous optimization. UACOR includes algorithmic components from ACOℝ,DACOℝ and IACOℝ-LS, three ACO algorithms for continuous optimization that have been proposed previously. Thus, it can be used to instantiate each of these three earlier algorithms; in addition, from UACOR we can also generate new continuous ACO algorithms that have not been considered before in the literature. In fact, UACOR allows the usage of automatic algorithm configuration techniques to automatically derive new ACO algorithms. To show the benefits of UACOR's flexibility, we automatically configure two new ACO algorithms, UACOR-s and UACOR-c, and evaluate them on two sets of benchmark functions from a recent special issue of the Soft Computing (SOCO) journal and the IEEE 2005 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC'05), respectively. We show that UACOR-s is competitive with the best of the 19 algorithms benchmarked on the SOCO benchmark set and that UACOR-c performs superior to IPOP-CMA-ES and statistically significantly better than five other algorithms benchmarked on the CEC'05 set. These results show the high potential ACO algorithms have for continuous optimization and suggest that automatic algorithm configuration is a viable approach for designing state-of-the-art continuous optimizers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The capacitated arc routing problem is a well-studied problem in the Transportation/Logistics/OR literature. The problem consists of identifying the minimum cost routes required to service (e.g., pickup or deliver) demand located along the edges of a network. Unfortunately, the problem belongs to the set of NP-Hard problems; consequently, numerous heuristic and metaheuristic solution approaches have been developed to solve it. In this article, an ant colony optimization based metaheuristic is presented. Modifications are introduced for various components of the ant colony metaheuristics; specifically for those associated with the "initial population", the "ant decision rule" and the "local search procedure". The new metaheuristic was tested on seven standard test networks for the capacitated arc routing problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs extremely well vis-{\`{a}}-vis the state-of-the-art metaheuristics for the problem. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The roots of swarm intelligence are deeply embedded in the biological study of self-organized behaviors in social insects. From the routing of traffic in telecommunication networks to the design of control algorithms for groups of autonomous robots, the collective behaviors of these animals have inspired many of the foundational works in this emerging research field. For the first issue of this journal dedicated to swarm intelligence, we review the main biological principles that underlie the organization of insects' colonies. We begin with some reminders about the decentralized nature of such systems and we describe the un- derlying mechanisms of complex collective behaviors of social insects, from the concept of stigmergy to the theory of self-organization in biological systems.We emphasize in partic- ular the role of interactions and the importance of bifurcations that appear in the collective output of the colony when some of the system's parameters change. We then propose to categorize the collective behaviors displayed by insect colonies according to four functions that emerge at the level of the colony and that organize its global behavior. Finally, we ad- dress the role of modulations of individual behaviors by disturbances (either environmental or internal to the colony) in the overall flexibility of insect colonies. We conclude that fu- ture studies about self-organized biological behaviors should investigate such modulations to better understand how insect colonies adapt to uncertain worlds.},

Many applications exist for MCNFPs for instance supply chains, logistics, production planning, communications and transportations. Concave costs are, in many applications, more realistic than linear ones because of the association of prices with economies of scale. When concave costs are introduced in MCNFPs, then the difficulty to solve them increases and they become NP-Hard. Solution methods developed for these problems comprise both exact and approximate algorithms, the latter ones usually of a heuristic type. What we propose to do in this work is to present an overview of the past and most recent literature published on the subject.},

We propose it as a viable new approach to stochastic combinatorial optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positive feedback, distributed computation, and the use of a constructive greedy heuristic. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence, and the greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search process. We apply the proposed methodology to the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP), and report simulation results. We also discuss parameter selection and the early setups of the model, and compare it with tabu search and simulated annealing using TSP. To demonstrate the robustness of the approach, we show how the ant system (AS) can be applied to other optimization problems like the asymmetric traveling salesman, the quadratic assignment and the job-shop scheduling. Finally we discuss the salient characteristics-global data structure revision, distributed communication and probabilistic transitions of the AS.},

abstract = {Scientific literature is prolific both on exact and on heuristic solution methods developed to solve optimization problems. Although the former methods have an indisputable theoretical value when it comes to solve large realistic combinatorial optimization problems they are usually associated with large and even prohibitive running times. Heuristic methods, do not guarantee to determine a global optimal solution for a problem but are usually able to find a good solution rapidly, perhaps a local optimum, and require less computational resources. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms belong to a class of heuristics based on the behaviour of nature ants. These algorithms have been used to solve many combinatorial optimization problems and have been known to outperform other popular heuristics such as Genetic Algorithms. Therefore, we believe that the number of ACO based algorithms will continue to grow for a long time. The contribution of this work is to provide the reader with a sort of consultation guide for developing ACO algorithms, by presenting a collection of different approaches that can be found in literature, regarding the ACO building blocks.},

In undisturbed older colonies, each activity was done by a distinct group of workers. In undisturbed younger colonies, nest maintenance workers were likely to forage. Further experiments examined the conditions under which workers of each task group engaged in other activities. Marked workers were observed in the course of perturbations that increased the numbers engaged in one activity. In response to perturbations, most workers would switch tasks to forage, and nest maintenance workers were likely to switch to other tasks. Previous work showed that changes in the numbers of ants engaged in one activity alter the numbers engaged in other activities. The experiments with marked individuals described here show that task switching among exterior workers does not account for the observed responses to perturbations. This means that within a time scale of several hours, one worker group receives information about events affecting other worker groups. In social insect colonies, workers tend},

The emergent collective intelligence of social insects - swarm intelligence - resides not in complex individual abilities but rather in networks of interactions that exist among individuals and between individuals and their environment. In particular, a recently proposed model of division of labor in a colony of primitively eusocial wasps, based on a simple reinforcement of response thresholds, can be transformed into a decentralized adaptive algorithm of task allocation. An application of such an algorithm is proposed in the context of a mail company, but virtually any type of flexible task allocation can be described within the same framework. 1 Introduction Evidence of the ecological success of social insects can be found almost everywhere 56.

The ant colony optimization metaheuristic is a relatively new technique that was successfully adjusted and applied to many hard combinatorial optimization problems, including the minimum weight vertex cover problem. Some kind of hybridization or exploitation of the knowledge about specific problem often greatly improves the performance of standard evolutionary algorithms. In this article we propose a pheromone correction heuristic strategy that uses information about the best-found solution to exclude suspicious elements from it. Elements are suspicious if they have some undesirable properties that make them unlikely members of the optimal solution. This hybridization improves pure ant colony optimization algorithm by avoiding early trapping in local convergence. We tested our algorithm on numerous test-cases that were used in the previous research of the same problem and our algorithm uniformly performed better, giving slightly better results in significantly shorter time.},

This behavior is exploited in artificial ant colonies for the search of approximate solutions to discrete optimization problems, to continuous optimization problems, and to important problems in telecommunications, such as routing and load balancing. First, we deal with the biological inspiration of ant colony optimization algorithms. We show how this biological inspiration can be transfered into an algorithm for discrete optimization. Then, we outline ant colony optimization in more general terms in the context of discrete optimization, and present some of the nowadays best-performing ant colony optimization variants.

In this type of algorithms one usually tries to manage two conflicting aspects of searching behaviour: exploration, the algorithm's ability to search broadly through the search space; and exploitation, the algorithm ability to search locally around good solutions that have been found previously. In our case, we use an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to mainly deal with the exploration, and a Local Search algorithm to cope with the exploitation of the search space. Our method proves to be very efficient while solving both small and large size problem instances.
